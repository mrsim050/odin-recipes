        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Haleem (also called daleem, halim, etc.) is a Pakistani, Indian and/or Hyderabadi thick stew made with various grains, lentils (dal/daal), and meat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rolled Oats</li>
            <li>Basmati Rice</li>
            <li>Masoor Dal (Red Lentils)</li>
            <li>Urad (Mash) Dal</li>
            <li>Split Chana Dal (split chickpeas)</li>
            <li>Moong Dal (sometimes called Yellow Lentils)</li>
            <li>Meat (chicken/beef)</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Traditional whole and ground spices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Here's the plain and simple method broken down into 3 steps to give you an idea of how to make haleem in the Instant Pot.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak grains and lentils. Sauté onions, garlic, and ginger. Add the meat, sauté for a bit, then add the rest of the IP ingredients and pressure cook with the Meat/Stew Setting.</li>
            <li>Open the Pot. Remove the beef and give it just enough pulses in the food processor to shred. Then use an immersion blender to blend the lentils & grains. If you don't have an immersion blender, run the lentils and grains through the food processor too.</li>
            <li>Add oats and cook the haleem down. Once it starts bubbling, cover and slow cook until you can see the 'laced' consistency (or resha). If you're up for it, make a tadka. Garnish and serve!</li>
        </ol>
